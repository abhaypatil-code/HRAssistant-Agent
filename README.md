- Routes to appropriate data sources
- Gathers context from employee data and/or policy documents
- Generates responses using Gemini
- Adds citations for policy-based answers

#### 4. Streamlit App (`app.py`)

- Displays employee information

## 📊 Sample Data

### Employee Data
The project includes 15 sample employees across different departments:
- Engineering (6 employees)
- HR (3 employees)
- Marketing (3 employees)
- Finance (3 employees)

Each employee has:
- Personal info (name, email, phone)
- Department and role
- Manager assignment
- Joining date
- Leave balances (Casual, Sick, Earned)

### Policy Documents
Three comprehensive policy documents are included:

1. **Leave Policy** - All leave types, eligibility, application process
2. **Benefits Handbook** - Health insurance, financial benefits, perks
3. **Onboarding Guide** - First day, first week, 90-day plan

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
# Model Settings
MODEL_NAME = "gemini-1.5-flash"  # Change to gemini-pro for better quality
TEMPERATURE = 0.7                 # Lower for more deterministic responses
MAX_TOKENS = 1024                 # Increase for longer responses

# RAG Settings
CHUNK_SIZE = 1000                 # Size of document chunks
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200               # Overlap between chunks
RETRIEVAL_K = 4                   # Number of chunks to retrieve

# Query Classification Keywords
EMPLOYEE_KEYWORDS = [...]         # Keywords for employee queries
POLICY_KEYWORDS = [...]           # Keywords for policy queries
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "GOOGLE_API_KEY not found"**
- Solution: Make sure you've created a `.env` file with your API key
- Check that the `.env` file is in the `hr_copilot` directory

**Issue: "No employee data found"**
- Solution: Verify `data/employee_data.csv` exists
- Check file path in `config.py`

**Issue: "No policy documents found"**
- Solution: Click "📚 Load Default Policies" button
- Verify files exist in `data/policies/` directory

**Issue: "Error initializing embeddings"**
- Solution: Check your API key is valid
- Ensure you have internet connection
- Verify API key has not exceeded quota

**Issue: Slow response times**
- Solution: Reduce `RETRIEVAL_K` in config.py
- Use smaller documents
- Consider upgrading to Gemini Pro for better performance

## 📝 Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Data Storage**: Uses CSV files (not suitable for production scale)
2. **Authentication**: No user authentication (anyone can select any employee ID)
3. **Real-time Updates**: Employee data is static (no live sync)
4. **Document Processing**: Limited to PDF and TXT formats
5. **Scalability**: In-memory FAISS (not suitable for very large document sets)
6. **Query Routing**: Simple keyword-based (could be improved with ML)
7. **API Costs**: Gemini API has rate limits and quotas

### Known Issues
- Large PDFs may take time to process
- Very long conversations may exceed context window
- No conversation persistence (cleared on page refresh)

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a project for demonstration purposes. For production use, consider:
- Implementing proper authentication and authorization
- Using a production database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Adding comprehensive error handling and logging
- Implementing rate limiting and caching
- Adding extensive testing coverage
- Setting up monitoring and alerting
